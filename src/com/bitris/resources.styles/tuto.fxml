Six different shaped binary blocks go across the game field one after the other. The object of the game is to prevent blocks from piling up to the left of the game field by using the binary blocks to add up to the target number situated on the right of the game field. To do this, the binary blocks can be moved up, down and rotated. If you can acquire the target number, the number changes and the blocks disappear, and as a result you accumulate points. If the blocks pile up to the left, then thatâ€™s the end of the game. Controls are 'up' and 'down' arrows to move the brick up and down the screen; 'right' arrow to move the brick faster to the right of the screen, and 'space' to rotate the brick." wrapText="true" />
